Whisk espresso and Grand Marnier. Grand Marnier makes this a boozier tiramisu because there is alcohol in both the coffee mixture and the mascarpone cream. Grand Marnier’s flavor is great in this dessert, but you can skip it if desired. If you don’t have espresso, purchase espresso powder and follow the measurements in the recipe notes.
Dip half of the ladyfingers in the espresso mixture. Ladyfingers soak up a lot of liquid within 1 second, so make it a very quick dunk. You don’t want them overly saturated and soggy because as the tiramisu chills, they’ll soften up underneath all the cream.
Line dipped ladyfingers in bottom of pan. If needed, cut some ladyfingers to fill in any empty spaces.
Beat mascarpone and rum together. Use quality mascarpone. I like BelGioioso brand (not sponsored– truly what I always use). Though this is primarily an espresso-flavored dessert, tiramisu has rum as well.
Gently cook egg yolks and sugar. Egg yolks are a main ingredient in tiramisu. Use a double boiler or makeshift bowl/saucepan double boiler to cook egg yolks and sugar together. Maida’s recipe also uses the egg whites, which come soon after this step.
Beat egg yolks into mascarpone cream mixture.
Whip heavy cream and vanilla extract into medium peaks.
Fold whipped cream into mascarpone cream mixture. 
Beat the egg whites and salt together until foamy, then slowly pour in sugar and beat until stiff peaks form.
Fold egg white mixture into mascarpone cream mixture.
Layer half of the cream mixture on top of the ladyfingers. An offset spatula helps.
Dip and layer remaining ladyfingers.
Top with remaining cream mixture, then chill for for 2-3 hours. 
Dust with cocoa. After chilling for a couple hours, dust the top layer with a dense layer of unsweetened cocoa powder. Use a sifter. This is a classic finishing touch to the entire tiramisu dessert.
Chill overnight. You can chill it for up to 1 day, so it’s a great make-ahead dessert recipe.
